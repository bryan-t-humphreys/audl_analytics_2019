# American Ultimate Disc League Analytics Project
#### Bryan Humphreys

This is the README document for the AUDL Analytics project.  All data used in this project was sourced from the [UltiAnalytics](https://www.ultianalytics.com/index.html) webpage.

The 2019 AUDL season was analyzed.  Each team recorded play-by-play events for every game of the season.  In the [/data/](https://github.com/bryan-t-humphreys/audl_analytics_2019/tree/master/data) folder, we see a .csv file for every team.

**Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for further analysis**
The `utils.py` script contains all of utility functions created and used for the analysis.
The [/unit_tests/](https://github.com/bryan-t-humphreys/audl_analytics_2019/tree/master/unit_tests) folder contains a few small unit tests.
